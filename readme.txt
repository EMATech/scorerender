Renders inline sheet music fragments in post, pages and comments.

== Description ==

ScoreRender is a Wordpress plugin for rendering sheet music fragments into images.  It supports converting fragments in excerpts, posts, pages and (optionally) comments.  Currently it supports 4 music notations: ABC, Guido, Lilypond, Mup.

ScoreRender started its life from Chris Lambâ€™s FigureRender plugin, which is a Wordpress plugin for rendering LaTeX and Lilypond music fragments into images. Its maintainership changed later. While continue enhancing FigureRender, all LaTeX related functionalities are submitted to [LatexRender](http://sixthform.info/steve/wordpress/), thus preserving this plugin for music rendering only and the rename.

For latest version, detailed usage instructions and demo cases, please visit [ScoreRender official site](http://scorerender.abelcheung.org/).

== Installation ==

= Prerequisite =
1. Starting from ScoreRender 0.2, PHP4 compatibility is dropped, and PHP5 is strictly needed.
2. Starting from ScoreRender 0.2, ImageMagick >= 6.3.6-2 is needed, due to usage of -flatten option.
3. Any music rendering programs must also be installed in web server. For example, to support Lilypond fragments, Lilypond >= 2.8.1 must be installed in web server. Refer to [installation page](http://scorerender.abelcheung.org/installation/) for more detail.

= New install =
1. Install any prerequisite programs as noted above.
2. Extract archive, and copy 'scorerender' folder to wp-content/plugins/.
3. Login to WordPress and enable the plugin in admin interface.
4. Configure ScoreRender under the ScoreRender tab of the Options page.
5. In Option -> Writing, check if this option is turned on:

       "WordPress should correct invalidly nested XHTML automatically"

   It must be turned off if you intent to render Lilypond and Mup fragments,
   since this option will convert "<<" and ">>" into "< <" and "> >"
   correspondingly, thus destroying the music content and cause render error.

= Upgrade =
1. Deactivate the plugin in WordPress admin page.
2. Remove the whole plugin folder.
3. Upload new plugin and activate again.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It just complains about some obscure error! =

The error code indicates the kind of error in some degree. There are comments inside wp-scorerender.php indicating what kind of error it is. If you can't make any heads and tails out of PHP code, feel free to ask me [through email](http://me.abelcheung.org/aboutme/).

= Is any ABC notation compatible program also supported? =

Since 0.2, [abcm2ps](http://moinejf.free.fr/) will be the only one supported. This is a design decision. If you REALLY want to use other similar programs, you are on your own, though modifying the code to support others is not very hard. Take a look at is_notation_usable() method in class.abc.inc.php.

= I want to remove cache for 1 image and re-render, but how can I determine which is which? =

Right now you have to view HTML source to find out cache image file name. Management of cache is planned in future, but can't say when.

= Images using Guido notation seems blurred. =

This may not be fully fixable, because setting font attributes may not be possible for all text. After image resizing, they can be rendered smaller / larger than desired.

= How to debug my fragment when posting ? =

Simply put, no. There is no viable method for debugging a fragment yet. The best way is render it privately in your computer first, then post the content, rather than spending lots of time doing trial and error.
